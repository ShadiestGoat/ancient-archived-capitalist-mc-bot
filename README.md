Heya! This I've been digging around in my old projects, and hey look at what I found: my first ever project. 
Now, notice how this code is the worst thing you've ever seen? Well, yeah. I've learnt python as my first language, and without really using resources like w3schools, just sort of jumping into it, which isn't a good way to learn, and leads to things like this.

This was originally made in mid 2020, and, well I have improved a lot since then. 

I've removed any sort of API keys, passwords, etc, so it doesn't really work, but, when everything is filled up, it does work. Problem is, while yes, it works, it is not good. It 9s filled with fundemental mistakes. 

I don't actually reccommend looking at this code, unless you want to force yourself to rip your eyes out. 

Please do not look at this code.
